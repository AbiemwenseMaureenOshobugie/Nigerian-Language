# Nigeria Major Languages App
![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Description
The Nigeria Major Languages App is a Streamlit web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect the major languages spoken in Nigeria based on user input text. The app is trained on a dataset containing texts in Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Pidgin languages. The trained model predicts the language of the input text, providing users with insights into the language used.

Note: To get optimum results, please ensure that the input text is written in one of the four languages: Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, or Pidgin. The accuracy of the language prediction may vary if non-Nigerian languages or mixed languages are used.
